# MAT330
Homeworks from my Introduction to Abstract Algebra course at SUNY Oswego. The book used was Dan Saracino's Abstract Algebra A First Course, second edition.

These homeworks are collected, graded, then returned with comments. After that we are allowed to do a rewrite and turn that in for the final grade.
